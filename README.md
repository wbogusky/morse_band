# morse_band

For my final project I tried to create a set of connected wearables which could conceivably been worn at the beach (or another location without sufficient WiFi / Cellular Data coverage) as long distance, unobtrusive communication between two individuals.

I ran into enough trouble working with the radio transceivers and the vibration motors that the housing received less attention than I would have hoped. That said, using the project was a fun and tactile experience with the provisional wristband I built.

Attached is my code which ran on both Arduinos along with a video demonstrating the functioning project. There was more footage depicting the RxTx in the other direction, but GitHub wouldn't let me upload such a long clip. Part of the setup code was copied from the RadioHead libary's rf_client and rf_server examples.
